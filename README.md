# -NumPy-CNN-Implementation-for-Image-Classification
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using only NumPy. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, ReLU activation, softmax output layer, and basic training and testing routines.

the loss and accuracy plots are as follows.
